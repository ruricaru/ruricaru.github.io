I am an Associate Professor at [Bordeaux University](http://www.u-bordeaux.fr/) and a researcher in the [BKB team](https://www.labri.fr/en/bench-knowledge-and-beyond) at the [LaBRI](http://www.labri.fr). 

My primary research field is *bioinformatics*, with a particular focus on modeling and analyzing large-scale biological data, specifically omics data, which is characterized by its massive scale and heterogeneity.

My research is centered around:

* the algorithmic aspects of analyzing genomic sequencing data
* the modeling, analysis, and extraction of biological information from omics data, using machine learning and data mining approaches.

Since 2022, I co-lead the [Systems and Data research department](https://www.labri.fr/en/systems-and-data-department) composed of the [BKB](https://www.labri.fr/en/bench-knowledge-and-beyond) and the [Progress](https://www.labri.fr/en/programming-networks-and-systems) teams at the [LaBRI](http://www.labri.fr).

I am also part of the head board of the [Bordeaux Bioinformatics Masters](http://master-bioinfo-bordeaux.github.io/) of the [Bordeaux University](http://www.u-bordeaux.fr/), as head of the 1st year of Masters.
