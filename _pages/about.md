I am an Associate Professor at [Bordeaux University](http://www.u-bordeaux.fr/) and a researcher at the [LaBRI laboratory](http://www.labri.fr) in the [BKB team](https://www.labri.fr/en/bench-knowledge-and-beyond). 

My main research field is bioinformatics and I am particularly interested in the modeling and the analysis of large-scale biological data, namely omic data, which is known to be massive and heterogeneous. The approaches I develop cover several axes including:

*the algorithmic aspects concerning the analysis of genomic sequence data produced by sequencing technologies
*the modeling, the analysis and the extraction of biological information from omic data, involving learning and data mining approaches.

Since 2022, I co-lead the [Systems and Data research departement](https://www.labri.fr/en/systems-and-data-department) composed of the [BKB](https://www.labri.fr/en/bench-knowledge-and-beyond) and the [Progress](https://www.labri.fr/en/progress) teams at the LaBRI.

Since 2019, I am part of the head board of the [Bioinformatics Masters](http://master-bioinfo-bordeaux.github.io/) of the [Bordeaux University](http://www.u-bordeaux.fr/)  and I direct the 1st year.
