Since 2012, I am an Associate Professor at [[Bordeaux University|http://www.u-bordeaux.fr/]] and a researcher at the [[LaBRI laboratory|http://www.labri.fr]] in the [[BKB team|https://www.labri.fr/bench-knowledge-and-beyond]]. 

My main research field is bioinformatics and I am particularly interested in the modeling and the analysis of large-scale biological data, namely omic data, which is known to be massive and heterogeneous. The approaches I develop cover several axes including:

	** the algorithmic aspects concerning the analysis of sequence data produced by NGS technologies
	** the modeling, the analysis and the extraction of biological information, involving learning and data mining approaches.

Since 2022, I co-lead the [[Systems and Data research departement|https://www.labri.fr/bench-knowledge-and-beyond]] composed of the BKB and the Progress teams at the LaBRI.

Since 2019, I am part of the head board of the [[Bioinformatics Masters|http://master-bioinfo-bordeaux.github.io/]] of the [[Bordeaux University|http://www.u-bordeaux.fr/]] and I direct the 1st year.
